# Scruffy Muffins Doggy Daycare

## Description

This project is a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data and front end to simulate a working web application and makes use of the tools that would be used to create a full MERN stack application.

* ongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
